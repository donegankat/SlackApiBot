{
	// ***********************************************************************************************
	// The settings in this file override the settings in the normal appSettings.json file if the
	// application is executed with the ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT environment variable of "Production".
	// This environment variable is automatically set to this when launching from Visual Studio with
	// the "Production Environment" launch option, or the variable can be passed from the command line
	// or PowerShell when executing the .exe directly.
	// You can refer to the Pipeline-RunSlackApiBot.yml pipeline definition that runs this tool to see
	// an example of how to execute this program using PowerShell and provide environment variables
  // like ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT.
	//
	// All settings in either this file or in appSettings.json can be overridden during execution by
	// passing in environment variables. PowerShell is an easy way to do this. See the pipeline for
	// examples, and refer to Microsoft for more information:
	// https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/?view=aspnetcore-6.0#non-prefixed-environment-variables
